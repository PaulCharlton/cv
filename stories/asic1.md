First ASIC with Myarc - 1986

I designed a custom ASIC for Myarc’s new computer to integrate glue logic, DRAM control, keyboard input, virtual paged memory, and TI-99/4a emulation. Working with Mitsubishi Electronics of America, I trained on their EDA tools, created a 4000-gate netlist, and validated it with test vectors in just two weeks.

The first tape-out failed due to incorrect timing data in Mitsubishi’s EDA database. I diagnosed the issue with custom boot ROMs, oscilloscope debugging, and hardware modifications, proving Mitsubishi’s error. They acknowledged the mistake and gave I a free second run, which I optimized further. The second ASIC worked, enabling a fully functional prototype that I showcased in Boston, Chicago, and Germany, marking a major milestone in TI-99/4a compatibility and performance innovation.
