SyscallInput --> VFS : syscall invoked
VFS --> RawPath : post-mount path
RawPath --> UTF16Mixed : convert to UTF-16
UTF16Mixed --> PUATagged : inject PUA
PUATagged --> UTF16_NFD_PUA : normalize (NFD)
UTF16_NFD_PUA --> NFKD_Compare : for compare/sort
UTF16_NFD_PUA --> DiskUTF8 : persist to disk
DiskUTF8 --> ReaddirOut : restore original syscall format
ReaddirOut --> SyscallInput : round-trip complete

note bottom
  VFS resolves only the mount point.
  Clustered XFS owns the remaining path segment.
  Unicode normalization, PUA tagging,
  and round-trip identity are driver-enforced.
