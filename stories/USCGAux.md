US Coast Guard Auxiliary - 2010 to present
* Director of Computer Software and Systems (O6 equivalent) - 2012 to 2014



### Overview 
The United States Coast Guard Auxiliary is a branch of the Coast Guard authorized by Congress as an all-volunteer non-military force to patrol waterways within the United States.  Just like the active duty and reserve Coast Guard branches, it reports to the Commandant of the Coast Guard.  In many ways it is similar to the Civil Air Patrol which reports to the Air Force.  The CGAUX, at roughly 30,000 members, is about somewhat smaller than the active duty and three times larger than reserve forces, coming in at over one-third of the Coast Guard's available assets.

### Inception
I initially joined the first week of 2010 at the urging of one of my boating friends.   At the time, I owned a small (24 ft) former military RIB which I frequently used on the San Francisco bay along the waterfronts of San Francisco, Sausalito, Tiburon, Richmond, and Oakland.

My initial goal as a member of the CGAUX was to contribute, as a first responder, to search and rescue (SAR) missions in that general geographic area. I took many training courses to become a qualified boat crew member, and eventually coxswain (small boat captain).  Radio communication, navigation, teamwork, chain of leadership, damage control, live saving, weather, and many others.  I outfitted my RIB in order to qualify it as a Coast Guard "facility" and started performing regular patrol missions with a small crew of between 3 and 8 people.

As a team lead for boat patrols, I also coordinated patrol orders with the local Coast Guard liaison and took every single available FEMA course on the Coast Guard list, including those on incident leadership.   As a first-responder and first-on-scene, the boat patrol leader became the first "on scene coordinator" until a formal handoff to local law enforcement or other agency.

Over the first year, I participated in dozens of patrols, sometimes 2-3 per week, many on my boat, and many on the boats of other CGAUX members.   Among the patrols we performed, some of them were "event management" for fireworks, airshows, and major boating events.   We also assisted the active-duty Coast Guard in many of their training exercises, including air drops of aid from C130 transport planes, and training with helicopters as on-the-water assets during their swimmer training missions.  We also obtained official orders to participate in regional OPTREX (operational training exercises) with federal, state, and local law enforcement from many agencies.

### Measurements Directorate - 2010 to 2022

During the course of my SAR patrols I became friends with one of the officers who was also a member of the National Staff for the CGAUX.  He was the team lead for the Measurements Directorate which was responsible for all technology supporting business intelligence and operational metrics of the >30,000+ person organization.  This included requirements for deployment of data warehousing and data analytics linked to legacy systems and application of quantitative analytics. For all of the operations of CGAUX.  His position was Division Chief for Measurements (O5 equivalent - like, LT CDR), and once he learned my background and skills he invited me to the position under him of "Branch Chief, Measurements" -- this position required an appointment by the National Commodore of the CGAUX, which after I obtained after an interview process with several heads of departments on the National Staff -- it was a commission, and an honor, to work with the National Staff.

In this new role, which I stayed in for a  year, I was responsible for instrumenting and gathering operational data from as many different types of missions as possible.  The role also analyzed data regarding volunteer impact on the overall Coast Guard mission, measured in dollars and volunteer hours.  At the time, the CGAUX was donating over one million hours per year to the overall Coast  Guard mission, and we estimated the impact at over \$200 million per year in contribution to the CG Mission.   The role required numerous written reports summarizing data for each of the operational missions of CGAUX to be delivered to the various department heads on the National Staff.  Through this process I was able to meet many of the heads of other departments.

At the end of the first year, I was honored and "promoted" to serve as DVC ("Division Chief", O5 equivalent, like Commander) in charge of all Measurements, Metrics, and Data Analysis for the CGAUX.  This expanded my sphere of connections to the more senior National Staff, such as the Deputy NACOs and ANACOs (roles which are equivalent to O7 and O8, like Lower Rear Admiral and Upper Rear Admiral).  During this year, I instrumented and collected data from our IT infrastructure, including metrics related to cybersecurity.
