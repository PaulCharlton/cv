🚀 In 💡Competence: From Chaos to Cash - Part 3

10 People, 69 Days, $1 Billion Gain in 15 Days

🔹 Sun Microsystems Inc - 2008
🔹 Principal Consulting Engineer - JavaFX Project

🟠 Part III: Moving the Goal Posts, Sprinting, and the winning Touchdown

After launching the technical team, my next challenge was reducing scope without compromising impact.

📌 Mission:
✔ Align with outside customers to avoid surprises
✔ Negotiate feature cuts with product management
✔ Prioritize flawless digital video playback over “nice-to-haves”

📉 The result?
We cut 15% of product manager wish-list features, ensuring JavaFX 1.0 would ship on time while still delighting customers.


💀 Sprinting: The grind was real. For six weeks, I worked with my 10-person strike team:
✔ 7 days a week
✔ 20+ hours a day
✔ Sleeping on yoga mats in the office

🚀 What we built:
✅ A modern multimedia pipeline
✅ Asynchronous I/O for ultra-smooth video playback
✅ 10-second buffer to eliminate frame drops
✅ Audio-driven synchronization (adjusting playback to real-time clock)
✅ Full multithreading, eliminating the single-threaded bottleneck of Swing/AWT

🎯 Goal: Videos must play smoothly on everything—from low-end Java mobile phones to 4K desktop setups.

🎉 Code Complete.  Touchdown

We presented the new JavaFX to Sun’s leadership team and key outside customers.

✔ Smooth, synchronized video playback
✔ Responsive UX
✔ Flawless streaming over the internet

💡 Customers were thrilled. But we weren’t done yet.

📅 Thanksgiving Weekend (Nov 27–30, 2008)

While most of Sun enjoyed the holiday, three of us stayed back, working 20-hour days to:
✔ Refactor & document code
✔ Enhance SDK examples
✔ On-call support for outside developers co-launching with JavaFX

📊 Final tally:
🔹 30% of the original codebase deleted
🔹 40,000+ lines of new code added
🔹 10 engineers delivered 34 person-years of work in under 10 weeks

💡 We had pulled off the impossible. Now, the world would find out.
