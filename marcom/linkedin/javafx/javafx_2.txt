🚀 In 💡Competence: From Chaos to Cash - Part 2

10 People, 69 Days, $1 Billion Gain in 15 Days

🔹 Sun Microsystems Inc - 2008
🔹 Principal Consulting Engineer - JavaFX Project

🟠 Part II: Engagement

📅 Friday, October 10, 2008

I told my friend I could fix JavaFX, but I needed to assemble the right team—experts in digital video, audio synchronization, and performance engineering.

	“What’s the budget if we deliver on time?”
It was a big number.

That weekend, I reached out to QuickTime engineers and others from my QTML development days at Apple.

📅 Monday, October 13, 2008

By 7:30 AM, I reported back:
✅ I had 5 elite engineers ready to start.
✅ I wanted 5 more from Sun’s best and brightest to form a 10-person strike team.
✅ We could meet the deadline—but it required 120+ hour weeks.

💰 He agreed. By that afternoon, we launched.

🎯 Fixing the Core Problem: Video Playback

JavaFX’s video playback was fundamentally broken—like a choppy flipbook instead of smooth motion.

🚨 Common rookie mistake:
1️⃣ Wait for the correct display time
2️⃣ Read frame data
3️⃣ Decode video frame
4️⃣ Display video frame

❌ The flaw? Step #3 (decoding) takes longer than the frame interval, creating stuttering, lag, and audio desync.

💡 The JavaFX team’s biggest misconception:
They assumed audio and video could be processed separately and still remain synchronized—they couldn’t.

🛠️ The Plan: Total War on Latency

By 2 PM, I gave the team a crash course on:
✔ Smooth video rendering
✔ Audio-driven playback synchronization
✔ Asynchronous I/O to prevent frame drops
✔ Why native code was essential for performance

That afternoon, we:
🔹 Bought workstations & software (some on my credit card!)
🔹 Took over a large conference room for our war room
🔹 Covered every wall with whiteboards (Home Depot shower panels + wax = DIY whiteboards)

🎥 Final goal:
📌 The system was ready only when our test videos played perfectly on:
✔ Low-end Java mobile phones
✔ High-end desktops, handling 4K video

🔥 Engineering Discipline: No Shortcuts

📌 Test-Driven Development (TDD) was mandatory.
📌 Every feature had to meet “customer delight” UX standards.
📌 We added thousands of lines of observability code—because what you can’t measure, you can’t fix.

💡 We were in. The grind had begun. The countdown to launch had started.
