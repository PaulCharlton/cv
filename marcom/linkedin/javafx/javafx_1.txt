🟠 Part I: The Crisis and Bleak Horizon

📅 Friday, Sept 26, 2008

A longtime friend invited me to lunch at Sun Microsystems’ Santa Clara campus. We had worked together at Apple, C2B, JavaSoft (Sun), and multiple startups. Now, he had just been promoted to SVP over 2,000 Java engineers.

🚨 He was in trouble. JavaFX—Sun’s answer to Microsoft Silverlight & Adobe Flash—was set to launch in just 10 weeks on Dec 4, 2008.
	•	3 years and 300+ engineer-years invested
	•	No clear path to a working product
	•	Investors and customers expecting an on-time release

I asked about engineering process and governance, but his answers were vague. Then, he dropped the big question:

	“Can you look at this in depth and tell me when we’re really going to ship?”

📌 The situation:
✔ 350,000+ lines of code
✔ 150 engineers still working
✔ No working multimedia pipeline

I agreed to analyze the team, customers, and codebase and deliver a report in 10 business days.

I returned with my findings after:
✔ Meeting engineers, architects, and product managers
✔ Securing a formal contract with Sun
✔ Speaking to key customers about their expectations
✔ Reverse-engineering the entire codebase in Sparx Enterprise Architect

💀 The verdict? JavaFX wouldn’t ship for another 18 months—April 2010 at best.

Instead of being shocked, my friend sighed in relief — this was still more optimistic than his own team’s estimates.

🚨 The biggest failure? Video playback.
The product lacked domain expertise in digital video & audio synchronization — a fatal flaw for a media-rich application.

❌ Naïve, single-threaded event loop
❌ No buffering, latency correction, or real-time synchronization
❌ Jerky, un-synchronized playback

After absorbing my breakdown, he leaned forward and asked:

	“Can you do something about it? Can we still meet the December launch if you help?”

💭 Could I help my friend?
