🧠 Dare me to do it again.
30 million lines of spaghetti C. One router OS. Zero thread safety. Let’s party.

In 2008, Cisco’s board had a simple question:
“Why aren’t our routers faster, even though they all ship with multicore CPUs now?”

The CTO’s answer?

“IOS is 30 million lines of C. It’s not thread-safe. We’d need a total rewrite. Cost: tens of millions. Timeline: several years.”

🥱 Cute.
Cisco hired me instead.

I was brought in by a VP of Engineering as a last-ditch effort:
“Can we make IOS scale with multicore, without rewriting it all from scratch?”

✅ Week 1: I built a fully thread-safe, preemptible, in-memory async message queue system. Then I carved the IOS runtime into four logical threads:
	1.	Inbound packets
	2.	Routing/filtering
	3.	Outbound packets
	4.	System overhead (heap mgmt, housekeeping, etc.)

Each one isolated. Communicating only via my new async queues.

✅ Week 2: I sliced those four into two dozen concurrent components, replacing every unsafe internal function call with async local procedure calls (LPCs) using message queues. Yes, it added a bit of marshalling overhead. No, it didn’t matter.

💥 The result? IOS scaled.
Core-for-core, thread-for-thread, near-linear performance gains.
From single-threaded monolith to multicore beast mode—with no rewrite.

The system kept all cores saturated. No race conditions. No deadlocks.
Just raw performance, powered by surgical precision.

You’ve got legacy code choking your hardware?

Your CTO says “rewrite” and your CFO faints at the price tag?

Bring in someone who sees thread safety as a challenge, not a blocker.
Someone who tames 30 million lines of C and makes it dance across CPU cores.

Dare me to do it again.
