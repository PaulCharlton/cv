ðŸ§  Dare me to do it again.
Custom silicon. One teenager. Two ASICs. Zero fear.

In 1986, while still in college, I was asked by Myarc to design their first ASICâ€”an ambitious plan to shrink an entire TI-99/4A-compatible motherboard into a single 4000-gate chip. No roadmap. No YouTube. Just me, some gate arrays, and a mandate to bend logic to my will.

I trained directly with Mitsubishiâ€™s EDA team, built the netlist, and verified the design with simulation vectorsâ€”all in under two weeks.

ðŸ’¥ First tape-out? Dead on arrival.
Not because of my logicâ€”but because Mitsubishiâ€™s own timing data was flawed.

I proved it, using custom boot ROMs, live oscilloscope traces, and hacked-together hardware mods. Mitsubishi acknowledged the issue, gave us a free second run, and I optimized the design even further.

âœ… Second tape-out? Perfect.
Fully functional prototype. Demoed in Boston, Chicago, and Germany. Real-time TI-99/4A emulation in a compact form factor. First of its kind.

Fast-forward to 1987: Myarc wanted a second ASICâ€”this time for a unified Hard/Floppy Disk Controller. I spent six days on-site with California Devices, running nonstop validation.

ðŸŽ¯ First tape-out: flawless.

That chip went into mass production and became one of the most advanced I/O controllers in the TI-99/4A world. California Devices offered me a job on the spot.

Two ASICs. One tape-out failure I didnâ€™t causeâ€”but fixed. One flawless run.
And a lifetimeâ€™s worth of lessons in design integrity, systems thinking, and getting it right when it counts.

You want silicon that just works?
You want a first-time-right result under pressure?
You want someone who lives for the impossible?

Dare me to do it again.
