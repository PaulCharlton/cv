Dare Me to Do It Again: JavaFX 1.0 Rescue 🚨

In late 2008, Sun Microsystems had a problem.
JavaFX — its answer to Flash and Silverlight — was scheduled to launch in 10 weeks.
300+ person-years invested.
Zero chance of shipping on time.

A longtime friend (and newly appointed SVP of Java) asked me to investigate.
After 10 days embedded with the team, I told him:
“You’re at least 18 months away from shipping.”
He asked:
“Can you fix it?”
I answered:
“Dare me.”

🔥 What followed was 10 weeks of intense, around-the-clock work:

✅ Built a 10-person strike team (5 of mine + 5 of Sun’s best)
✅ Deleted 30% of the legacy codebase
✅ Re-architected the multimedia pipeline from scratch
✅ Delivered smooth, synchronized video playback across platforms
✅ Wrote 40,000+ lines of test-driven, high-performance code
✅ Moved essential logic to native code for real-time performance
✅ Removed single-threaded event loop bottlenecks
✅ Negotiated out 15% of non-essential features with PMs & partners
✅ Slept on yoga mats and used shower panels as whiteboards
✅ Hit code-complete Nov 25, 2008
✅ Shipped JavaFX 1.0 — on time — Dec 4, 2008

📈 The impact?

Sun’s stock jumped 51% in 15 days — a $1.08B market cap swing.
Analysts called it “the first on-time software launch at Sun in over a decade.”
Just months later, Oracle acquired Sun for $7.4B.

Would I do it again?
You already know the answer.
