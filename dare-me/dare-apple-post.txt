💥 Dare Me to Do It Again!

In 1994, I joined Apple as Principal Engineer for QuickTime.

Within a month, I fixed the broken Windows 3.1 player in time for WWDC.

Then I went off-script.

Instead of porting QuickTime to Windows, I rebuilt macOS for Intel—solo.
Millions of lines. ROM, Toolbox, QuickDraw, all reimplemented in portable, thread-safe C/C++.
400 lines of platform-specific code. That’s it.

🚨 Along the way, I discovered my own code inside Microsoft’s Video for Windows SDK.
Turns out:
🔹 A rogue contractor leaked it to Intel
🔹 Intel passed it to Microsoft
🔹 Apple sued all three

I became Apple Legal’s technical expert, helped secure a $150M settlement, and led the cross-platform QuickTime effort (code-named QTML) into developer hands.

🎬 Pixar used our SGI port to post-produce Toy Story
🏆 QuickTime later won an Oscar
💻 QTML evolved into Carbon
📱 Carbon made macOS X viable, paving the way for iTunes, iPhone, and AppleTV
🌐 The QuickTime format spawned MP4, the backbone of streaming video today

When execs tried to kill QTML to protect Apple hardware margins, I took my MBO straight to CEO Gil Amelio and Chief Counsel Ed Stead.
We mobilized 60+ CEOs of partner companies to lobby for us.
Two weeks later, our future was secure.

I left Apple in 1996 after leading the main stage WWDC session on Cross-Platform QuickTime.

One dev.
Two years.
Three lawsuits.
One platform.
Billions of devices.

Dare me to do it again.
