Dare me to do it again.

I led a team of just 15 engineers working in the same codebase as 250 others. Here’s what we delivered:
 • More function points than the rest combined
 • 100x fewer defects in new code
 • Sustained 35 hours/week of flow time
 • Kept a steady 40-hour workweek while others pushed 60–80 during the crunch

We followed the same 6-month dev + 2-month integration cycle as everyone else.
We hit code complete on time — with no drama — and spent the final 2 months helping other teams catch up.

Same codebase. Same constraints. Completely different outcome.

That’s what happens when you optimize for flow, not fire drills.
Platform thinking. Engineering maturity. Sustainable velocity.
