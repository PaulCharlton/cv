🔥 Dare me to do it again!
Patents, precision optics, and a legacy of getting ripped off.

Let me tell you why I don’t romanticize patents.

Not because I don’t understand them.
Because I do.

I grew up watching my father change the world of telescope optics.
He invented a mirror grinding system with 40nm precision — twenty times better than anything before.
He replaced harmonic gear-driven garbage with belt-driven irrationality.
Yes, irrational math — to break Lissajous distortion cycles and create true, sub-wavelength smoothness.
It worked. It was patented (USPTO: 3,141,265).
Factories stole it within months.
He watched them do it — walked past machines running his design.
He never saw a cent.

Welcome to the real world.

“He who has the gold rules.”
— a wise attorney I once paid too much

So yeah… I don’t believe in patents.
I believe in execution. In legacy. In undeniable impact.

Still, I’ve filed a few.
A couple ended up under Apple’s name.
You might recognize them — they’re still shaping the way you experience media today.

🎯 US Patent 5,875,354 — Real-time AV Sync via Clock Drift Correction

Still used in every streaming platform you’ve ever touched.
Netflix, Zoom, YouTube, Twitch, OBS, you name it.
If your video doesn’t drift from your audio? Thank this one.

Dynamic, feedback-looped sample rate conversion for multiple unsynchronized clocks.
Sounds sexy? Because it is.

🧱 US Patent 5,825,359 — Compositing and Display Arbitration

Invented window manager compositing before Apple, Microsoft, or Linux made it mainstream.
Two queues: one for drawing, one for waiting.
No flicker. No race conditions.
Just beautiful, orderly pixels.

Modern GPU compositors still follow this blueprint.
macOS Quartz. Windows DWM. Wayland. Even Citrix.

🖼️ US Patent 5,949,434 — Anti-Banding Image Scaling

Invented adaptive pseudo-random scaling before AI did.
Solves the same problem DLSS, FSR, and Apple Neural Engine attack today:
→ Make things bigger without making them ugly.

We did it with lookup tables and a modded Bresenham.
Now they call it stochastic sampling in AI super-resolution.

💡 Want to talk about foresight?
I wasn’t trying to build hype.
I was solving problems that weren’t trendy yet.

And that’s the lesson.

If your invention’s value depends on enforcement? You’re already playing defense.

If you want to win —
Build things the world needs, not just things it protects.
