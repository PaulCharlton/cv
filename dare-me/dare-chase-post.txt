🧠 Dare me to do it again.
How I outsmarted IBM, modernized a global bank, and built online banking before it was cool.

In 1990, Chase Manhattan Bank hired me as Director of Advanced Technology. My job? Redesign everything in the retail bank that didn’t run on a mainframe or VAX. Translation: I was handed the chaos—and expected to bring order.

🔥 I overhauled the court-ordered levy system, reducing risk of multimillion-dollar penalties. Paper-based processing became real-time. 3 days → 2 hours. Failover. Redundancy. Double-keyed validation. Bulletproof.

🔥 I digitized the central cash vault, twelve stories underground, 80+ million in daily ATM cash, and literal gold bars. I tracked armored transfers, logged every shrink-wrapped $100K bundle, and reconciled vault inventory in real time.

🔥 IBM pitched a $100K/branch tech rollout. I built better for $20K. IBM tried to get me fired. The EVP said, “You’re staying. Just don’t mess with $600M/year of IBM business again.” Fair trade.

🔥 I reverse-engineered SNA LU6.2 comms, built Windows 3.1 online banking for VIP clients (some were nation-states), and integrated CICS with dial-up, secure wire auth, and GUI workflows—before “online banking” even had a name.

🔥 When a core dump leaked every private key for high-value wire transfers, I quietly rebuilt the system and launched a secret global key swap… starting with billion-dollar clients. One of the accounts? Tied to Iran-Contra. No one flinched.

🔥 I beat the IBM mainframe DDA batch posting system. 10M accounts. 600K transactions. Mainframe: 19 mins. My PC: 67 seconds in Borland C++. On a PS/2 tower. Yes, really.

And yeah… I won the office football pool too—with early AI and simulated annealing on Excel.

You want someone who doesn’t blink at billion-dollar problems?
You want mainframe integration, secure systems, and vendor disruption in the same breath?
You want tech leadership that delivers—quietly, precisely, and permanently?

Dare me to do it again.
