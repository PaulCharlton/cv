Dare Me to Do It Again: The Day Pixar Showed Me the Future (And Then Some)

In the spring of 1988, before the Loma Prieta earthquake and while the Embarcadero Freeway still sliced across San Francisco’s waterfront, I got a call that felt a little like stepping into the future. Tony Apodaca, then one of Pixar’s key technologists and the principal architect behind RenderMan, invited me to interview at their offices — not the famous Emeryville campus that came later, but a quiet, tucked-away building in Novato. A kind of technical monastery, humming with ideas.

Pixar had only recently been acquired by Steve Jobs for $10 million — chump change in hindsight, but a bold and risky bet at the time. The team was lean, legendary, and laser-focused. I thought I was being brought in to join their animation R&D efforts. Tony and I had shared time in the graphics lab at RPI, so I figured it would be about shaders, rendering algorithms, maybe a little deep math with Bill Reeves.

But when I arrived, I met Micky Mantle, head of engineering. And he had something else in mind.

What followed wasn’t a job interview so much as a quiet initiation. I was walked through their hardware labs. I met a handful of hardware and low-level systems designers. I saw a pre-release NeXT computer — Jobs’ other startup — sitting quietly on a workbench. I was shown a rough cut of “Tin Toy”, still months away from the Academy Award that would put Pixar on the map.

And then they showed me the secret project.

It wasn’t about movies. It was a classified image stitching system, co-developed with Hughes Aircraft. The goal was to take thousands of overlapping satellite photographs, detect shared features, and use custom VLSI hardware to stitch them into seamless, high-resolution composite maps — in real time. Rotation, translation, scaling — all in silicon. They were trying to compress what took hours of compute into something operationally instantaneous.

Then they showed me the images.

I saw fingers on hands. The claws of a claw hammer. This was 1988. The general public still thought in terms of 3-meter Landsat squares. But what I saw was sub-centimeter resolution — the kind of thing that only made sense if someone had pointed a Hubble-class telescope downward. And given what I knew from friends at Perkin-Elmer, where those mirrors were born, I had no doubt that’s exactly what had happened.

Pixar — the desk lamp studio — was quietly building a hardware pipeline for reconnaissance imagery. And they were asking if I could help architect that system. Could we push the pipeline into silicon? Could we outpace the Motorola CISC processors driving their current compute cluster by orders of magnitude?

I didn’t pursue this job further — I stepped aside.

I’d done it before. I turned away from MIT. Sidestepped Caltech. Declined a dozen offers from Silicon Valley firms and even AMD in Texas. Not out of fear. But because something deeper always tugged at me — a quiet instinct born from a semi-rural upbringing in Virginia. The hustle and density of the Valley, the pace of places like Marin or Austin — it never quite fit the rhythm of my soul at that moment in time. It was too much change, too fast. Too many sharp edges.

So I didn’t finish the process. I didn’t lean in.

But I walked away changed.

I had caught a glimpse of something extraordinary — a strange triangulation of Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and the black-budget frontier of aerospace — all converging in a quiet room in Novato. That day, I realized Pixar was never just a movie studio. It was something else entirely.

Seven years later, I found myself in their orbit again. My QuickTime team at Apple worked with Pixar on Toy Story post-production, and on the tricky CD-ROM game version.
Fifteen years after that, I was brought in again — this time to Disney Studios in Glendale, reviewing Pixar’s render farm architecture as they scaled into the cloud era.
In between, I reconnected with Micky Mantle, now at Broderbund, helping ship Myst and supporting my team during the early development of QuickTime for Windows and the QTML framework.

I never joined Pixar. But I stood at the edge of their early future — more than once — and saw that their ambitions extended far beyond animation. They were already mapping the world in ways most people wouldn’t understand for decades.

Dare me to do it again?
I’d go back to Novato in a heartbeat.
Not for the job —
but for the chance to stand, once again,
right on the edge of history —
quietly, attentively, just as I was.
