🚀 Dare Me to Do It Again: Hacking a Xerox Copier into a Laser Printer (1982)

Back in '82, a graphics shop owner asked me if I could turn his Xerox 5700 floor copier into a laser printer controlled by an Apple III.

I’d never touched either machine before.So I took them apart.

🔍 Inside the Xerox:• Digitally stepped laser drum• Raster line buffer• Discrete control board = hackable

💪 On a few weekends using a Commodore PET and GPIB breadboards, I had it raster-printing digital images.Then I reverse engineered Apple's PRN driver, built a custom GPIB controller, and hijacked their OS to push bitmaps directly from the Apple III to the Xerox.

💡 But I didn’t stop there.

I realized the Xerox drum and buffer could be reused in reverse to scan full-page raster images.Using darkroom color separation filters and edge-detected registration marks, I captured and aligned multiple passes into a full color composite, pixel-corrected with trapezoidal transforms.

The images were then imported into the Apple III’s 4K x 4K image system and printed to 35mm film.

🧠 Hardware:• Xerox 5700• Apple III (6502)• Custom GPIB + driver stack• Commodore PET (dev)• 35mm film printer

📈 Resolution: 300dpi scanned → 512x512 downsampled → 9-bit color → film output

⚙️ All built in about 12 weekends — from nothing but schematics, hex dumps, and sheer nerve.

Today you’d call it a startup.Back then, it was just a dare.

And yes — I’d do it again.Faster than your R&D team can finish their staff meeting.

💬 Got a wild hack from the 80s, 90s, or early 2000s? I want to hear it.
