I Automated a Biomedical Research Lab at 14—Using Voice Control, in Total Darkness

While most kids my age were grappling with freshman year of high school and puberty, I was reverse-engineering analog lab equipment at the University of Virginia School of Medicine and designing one of the first speaker-independent voice control systems—from scratch—in a pitch-black, lightless environment. At 14, I wasn’t just tinkering in my garage—I was a paid researcher integrating digital computers with legacy lab equipment that predated microprocessors.

It started two summers earlier, at age 12, when I interned in UVA’s anatomy research labs, mostly assisting with circuit design and helping graduate students optimize their manual data collection setups. By 14, I was a formal hourly employee. By 16, I was a full-time researcher—mentoring graduate students and occasionally instructing faculty on how to use systems I had designed and built myself. The University let me audit advanced courses and enroll in others for credit. I didn’t just shadow researchers—I was one.

My work focused on automating experimental processes in a darkroom-based vision research lab. The lab contained a dozen analog instruments—oscilloscopes, photometers, spectrophotometers, HPLCs, amplifiers—all dependent on knobs, dials, toggle switches, indicator lamps, and chart recorders. Nothing digital. And because this was a 100% darkroom environment, anything emitting light—status LEDs, pilot bulbs, even CRTs—had to be physically disabled.

So I cut the lamp leads, built latching TTL logic to sense their state, and wired them to a digital bus. I added relay-based actuation and D/A converters to provide digital override control for every analog input surface. Then I connected the whole system via GPIB and S-100 bus machines. The result? I could control and monitor every piece of lab equipment from software.

I wrote the drivers in 6502 assembly. This wasn’t just a control plane—it was a full, programmable experiment orchestration system that could initiate protocols, record and log data, respond to instrumentation state changes, and notify the human operator—all in complete darkness.

To communicate with the experimenter (often myself), I created an audio feedback system using pre-recorded voice snippets. To allow hands-free input, I designed what I now believe was one of the earliest pitch-independent, speaker-independent voice recognition systems. It used parametric matching with vector-quantized input, breath-pause detection, and a predefined dictionary of about 70 words.

One of my A/D systems became the foundation for a published experiment—“Extended sensitivity for the calcium selective electrode”—in Analytical Biochemistry (Sep 1986), a peer-reviewed paper that I contributed to long before most people have taken their first college midterm.

The lab began receiving visits from engineers at Tektronix, Beckman, Perkin-Elmer, Fisher Scientific, Waters, HP, and Bio-Rad—each trying to understand how a teenager had retrofitted their hardware to do things their manuals said were impossible.

I wasn’t trying to be a legend. I was just trying to get better signal-to-noise on a high-impedance membrane sensor. But sometimes, solving your own problem takes you places other people haven’t even imagined yet.
