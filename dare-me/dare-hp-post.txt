### 🚀 Dare Me to Do It Again: HP, NASA, and a Dozen Driver Stacks (1988–1990)

Fresh out of RPI, I joined Hewlett-Packard’s Storage and Scanner Division in Greeley, Colorado.

Clean air. Big sky. No nonsense.

Every HP employee could pitch new products, estimate ARR/ROI, and recruit engineers from *any* team—even if a project was months from launch. No sacred cows. Just numbers.

Management were facilitators, not gatekeepers.

I jumped in headfirst.

🔁 **First mission:** Build the full **SCSI/SCSI-II DASD and Autochanger stack** for HPUX and MPE.
- Written in **C** and **Pascal**
- Included **boot support** for HP9000 from SCSI
- Nobody else had done DASD drivers for preemptive OSes

🔧 **Next:** HP’s first **in-house SCSI-II VLSI chip**.
- Replaced 3rd-party chipsets
- I wrote the **entire test vector suite**
- ✅ **Worked on the first tape-out**

🚀 **Then came NASA.**
They wanted to recover Apollo and Mercury flight telemetry from aging magnetic tapes.

These were **non-standard formats**: NRZ, 7-bit, Manchester, diagonal domain…
Most tapes were deteriorated, some scrambled by "write-through", others water damaged.

I:
- Overrode the tape drive's internal data separator
- Streamed raw analog data to HPUX
- Wrote custom decoders per manufacturer
- Built a plug-in decoder architecture

Recovered ~20% of the archive. It was like exhuming lost science.

💬 **Then came Apollo.**
After HP acquired Apollo Computer, we had to integrate our SCSI storage stack into their **DOMAIN OS**.

Schedule? Brutal.
- **2 weeks on-site near Boston**
- **1 week off** back in Colorado

Apollo's OS was all **Pascal**.
Lucky for me: I'd already written Pascal drivers for MPE and HP boot ROMs.

We used their incredible toolchain: **DSEE**
- Integrated project mgmt + version control
- Better than anything I’ve seen since
(FYI: DSEE's team left, founded **Atria**, built **ClearCase**, acquired by IBM.)

We finished the port in a month.

Except one thing.

Every so often, accessing the autochanger would **freeze the workstation for 10–15 seconds**.
Apollo's OS team said: "It’s your bug."

I disagreed. And proved it.

Wrote custom **stack walkers and mutex reflectors**.
Traced it to a mutex deep in their kernel.
Patched it. Tested it. Shipped it.

Apollo team finally admitted it.

And while all this was happening?
My manager would find me at 1pm and say:
> "You've already done 8 hours. Go live your life."

I’d spend Colorado evenings hiking a **1,350-acre park**, while my ASICs simulated in silence.

Today you’d call this full-stack, cross-functional, edge-to-core R&D.

Back then? I just called it fun.

**Dare me to do it again?**
I’ll patch your OS, reverse your tapes, and ship your silicon...
**before your R&D team finishes their staff meeting.**
