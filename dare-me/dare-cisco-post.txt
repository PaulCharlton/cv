30 million lines of spaghetti C. One monolithic router OS. No thread safety. Let’s go.

In 2009, Cisco’s board was asking a simple question:
“Why aren’t our routers getting faster, even though every box now ships with multicore CPUs?”

The CTO’s answer?

“IOS is 30M lines of C. Not thread-safe. Needs a total rewrite. Tens of millions. Several years.”

So a friendly Cisco VP brought me on for a POC.

🔥 Week 1: I built a fully preemptible, thread-safe async message queue system and split the IOS stack into four independent components:
    •  Inbound packets
    •  Routing/filtering
    •  Outbound packets
    •  Heap/system management

🔥 Week 2: I broke those down into two dozen parallelized components, each communicating via async LPC (local procedure calls) instead of unsafe function calls. Yes, it added marshalling overhead. No, it didn’t matter.

🚀 The result?
Near-linear scaling across cores and hyper-threads.
The old single-threaded IOS turned into a multicore monster—without a rewrite.

No deadlocks. No races. Just performance.
Thread safety? Solved. Vendor excuses? Obliterated.

You’ve got legacy code choking on modern hardware?
Your CTO says “rewrite.” Your CFO says “no.”
Let me say this instead:

I don’t fear legacy. I turn it into leverage.
