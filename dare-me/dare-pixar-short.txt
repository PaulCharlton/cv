Dare Me to Do It Again: The Day Pixar Showed Me the Future (and Then Some)

In 1988, I was invited to a quiet building in Novato.

Not the famous Pixar campus. Not yet.
This was something more like a technical monastery.

Pixar had just been acquired by Steve Jobs.
RenderMan was still raw.
“Tin Toy” hadn’t yet won its Oscar.

I thought I was there to talk about animation tech.
Tony Apodaca and I knew each other from the RPI graphics lab.
Instead, they brought me into a back room — and showed me something no outsider was supposed to see.

A classified image stitching project.
Thousands of overlapping satellite photos.
Custom silicon. Real-time VLSI acceleration.

Then they showed me the images.

Subcentimeter resolution.
I saw fingers. The claws of a claw hammer.
In 1988.

The public was still thinking in Landsat-scale 3-meter blocks.
But I knew from friends at Perkin-Elmer — where Hubble’s mirrors were born — that this only made sense if someone had pointed that tech downward.

Pixar — yes, that Pixar — was building reconnaissance pipelines in hardware.
And they were asking if I could help architect it.

I stepped aside.

Not out of fear.
But because something quieter tugged at me — a rhythm from my semi-rural upbringing in Virginia. The pace, the density — it didn’t fit. Not then.

But I walked away changed.

I’d glimpsed a triangulation:
🎬 Hollywood
💻 Silicon Valley
🛰️ The black-budget aerospace frontier

All converging in a sterile room in Novato.

Pixar was never just a movie studio.
It was something else entirely.

Years later, I crossed paths again:
🎥 Toy Story post-production with my QuickTime team at Apple.
☁️ Render-farm reviews at Disney Studios.
🧩 Reconnected with Micky Mantle, who helped ship Myst.

I never joined Pixar.
But I stood on the edge of their future — more than once.

Dare me to do it again?
I’d go back in a heartbeat.
Not for the job —
But for that moment.
That clarity.
That quiet sense of history unfolding.
