🔥 Dare me to do it again! — How I designed a home computer, wrote the OS, and built custom ASICs from scratch — all before graduation.

From 1985–1989, I went full tilt with Myarc and the TI-99/4A community.
✅ Disassembled buggy ROMs.
✅ Open-sourced firmware patches.
✅ Unlocked massive performance boosts on disk controllers.
That alone earned me a seat at the table for Myarc’s next-gen machine: a 16-bit TI-99/4A-compatible computer with virtual memory and a real OS.

I didn’t just join the project — I became the project:

⚙️ Designed the ASIC (4,000 gate equivalents) using Mitsubishi’s tools.
✍️ Wrote 50,000 lines of assembler for the OS (MDOS) with multitasking, TI-99/4A emulation, device drivers, and memory paging.
🛠 Built the dev toolchain (assembler, linker, librarian, make, and even a C compiler).
🌐 Demoed the Geneve 9640 across the US and Germany.
💥 And when the first chip tape-out failed due to a vendor timing error? I proved it, got a free re-run, and shipped working silicon.

I did all of this while carrying 21 academic credits at RPI.

💬 Your turn.
If you:
	•	Wrote Z80, 6502, TMS9900, or 8086 assembler
	•	Bent SCSI or DRAM to your will
	•	Built your own tools because no one else had
	•	Reverse engineered your way out of a corner
	•	Bootstrapped a system before breakfast

…I want to hear from you.
