🧠 Dare Me to Do It Again: Digitizing Calligraphy with NTSC + a TI-99/4A (1983)

In the early ’80s, commercial A/D converters weren’t fast enough to digitize a full video frame at 1/60 sec.

So I built one.

📖 The goal? Typeset a calligraphic book — “A Miracle of Virginia: The School for Statesmen” — using a custom font captured from handwritten glyphs.

I wired up a MATV-0816 A/D converter to a TI-99/4A, and clocked it with a 12-bit programmable counter tied to each NTSC scanline. Once per video field (1/60 sec), I scanned a vertical slice of the image one pixel at a time — sampling at ~16 kHz to capture a high-res column using hand-tuned TMS9900 assembly.

⚠️ Gotchas included:
	•	Detecting and compensating for interlaced video odd-field jitter
	•	Modeling and subtracting background light gradients
	•	Doing vectorization and edge detection in TI BASIC 😳

Result? A 525x4096px high-fidelity 8-bit scan per glyph.

🖋️ Once digitized, I transferred the raster images to a KayPro II running CP/M using a custom serial protocol I wrote in Z80 and TMS9900 assembly.

From there:
	•	Added kerning/spacing hints by hand
	•	Used a font layout tool called FancyFonts
	•	Printed each page on an Epson RX80 dot matrix, with pixel-aligned overstrikes to get true blacks

📦 The book was published in January 1984 — the first time this kind of capture+render pipeline was done entirely outside a mainframe or professional typesetter.

It was a one-off miracle of homebrew imaging.
And yes — I’d do it again.
