🔥 Dare me to do it again!
High-Mix, Low-Volume Manufacturing. Thailand. 3% gain requested. I found 100%.

The CEO brought me in to increase factory line capacity by 2–3%.
I spent a week on the floor. Different times. Different days. Same story.

🚨 Half the assembly lines were stopped. Red lights blinking.
📊 After dozens of observations, the stats were in. We weren’t at 98%.
We were idling at 50%.

I brought this to the CEO.

His response?

“I can’t share this with my team…
They just passed an efficiency audit.
It would shame all of my direct reports.”

😬 Western mind meets Eastern face culture.

He paid me…
To keep looking for smaller problems.

So I did.
I hand-harvested machine logs. Created a scratch-built database.
Ran spectral analysis on every automation station.

🕐 3 daily dips, ~1 hour each = 15% lost productivity.

I took it to him.

His response?

“Those are shift changes. My staff already ‘fixed’ that.
I can’t show them this.”

😐 Another sigh.
Another payment.

So I went again.

📦 This time, the bottleneck was component contention.
Multiple lines. One reel of expensive inventory (CPU, RAM).
Only one line could run.

🔁 My proposal: split reels at batch setup.
Give each batch a partial reel.
Reduce inter-line lockouts. +3–5% capacity.

He loved it.
We presented together that afternoon.

🧠 Sometimes the hardest part of optimization isn’t math.
It’s culture. politics. psychology. pride.

🎯 But if you can navigate those?
You can still find the win.
