### 🚀 Dare Me to Do It Again: HP, NASA, and a Dozen Driver Stacks (1988–1990)

Fresh out of RPI, I joined Hewlett-Packard’s Storage and Scanner Division in Greeley, Colorado. The job? A lifestyle upgrade. Clean air, big sky, and a culture where *anyone* could pitch product ideas, estimate ARR/ROI, and recruit engineers from other teams—even if a product was 6 months from shipping.

Management? Facilitators.
Promotions? Based on seniority, not merit.
Impact? Unlimited, if you made the numbers work.

✨ I jumped in headfirst.

First: I rewrote the **entire SCSI/SCSI-II DASD and Autochanger stack** for HPUX and MPE, in **C** and **Pascal** respectively, including boot support from SCSI on HP9000 workstations. No one else in the building had done DASD on fully preemptive OSes before.

Next: I co-designed HP’s **first in-house SCSI-II VLSI chip**, turning a board full of discrete logic into a clean, functional netlist. I wrote all the **test vectors** myself. It worked **on the first tape-out.**

Then came **NASA.** They wanted to recover flight telemetry from **Apollo and Mercury-era magnetic tapes.** I built drivers to stream raw signal data, then wrote **manufacturer-specific decoders** for dozens of exotic formats: NRZ, 7-bit, Manchester, diagonal domain, and more. Most tapes were degraded. We managed to recover **~20% of the archive**, but it felt like resurrecting ghosts from the Cold War.

Then came Apollo Computer. HP acquired them, and we were asked to integrate our tape and magneto-optic storage with Apollo's workstations running **DOMAIN OS**.

We ran an intense schedule: **2 weeks on-site near Boston, 1 week off back in Colorado**.

Apollo's OS was all **Pascal**, which was lucky: I'd already written Pascal drivers for MPE and HP boot ROMs. Their toolchain, **DSEE**, had the best integrated project + version control I’ve ever seen. (Fun fact: the DSEE team left HP and founded **Atria**, which created **ClearCase**, which IBM later bought.)

We ported everything in under a month—except one issue: autochanger access sometimes **froze the system** for 10–15 seconds.

Apollo's OS team said: "It’s your bug."
I said: "Wanna bet?"

I wrote **stack walkers and mutex reflectors**, traced the lock contention, and submitted a patch. Their kernel. Their lock. Their problem. Fixed.

Oh, and I did all this while my boss kicked me out of the office every afternoon at 1pm:
> "You’ve already done 8 hours. Go live your life."

I spent summer nights exploring a **1,350-acre park**, watching hawks fly while my ASICs simulated in cleanroom silence.

Today you’d call this full-stack, cross-functional, edge-to-core R&D.

Back then, I just called it fun.

**Dare me to do it again?**
I’ll patch your OS, reverse your tapes, and ship your silicon...
**before your R&D team finishes their staff meeting.**
