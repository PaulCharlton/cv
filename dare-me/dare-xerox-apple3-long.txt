💥 Dare Me to Do It Again!

Homebrew Laser Printer – Summer 1982

What happens when a medical graphics vendor asks if I can turn his Xerox 5700 floor copier into a laser printer controlled by an Apple III?

🔧 Challenge accepted.

I had zero prior experience with either machine. So I dissected both. Turns out the Xerox had:
	•	A digitally stepped laser drum
	•	A simple line buffer board for raster data
	•	A clear separation between optics, motor, and logic

Over the next few weekends, I built a GPIB-controlled raster interface from scratch using a Commodore PET and breadboards. Once I got it to print digital graphics, I moved to wire-wrapped circuit boards and began integrating with the Apple III.

Apple, of course, wouldn’t give me the specs.
So I reverse engineered their PRN driver, added GPIB support, and hijacked the OS to route raster data directly into the Xerox.

✅ First weekend: made it print.
✅ Next few weekends: made it scan.

I rigged up a color scanning system by inserting darkroom color separation filters, capturing each layer via raster reads into the Apple III, and aligning color layers using crosshair registration marks. I even wrote a trapezoidal correction algorithm to fix optical drift from imperfect filter placement.

The result?
A full-blown digital color raster scanner and printer rigged out of:
	•	📼 A Xerox 5700 copier
	•	🍏 An Apple III
	•	🧠 Reverse-engineered drivers
	•	🔌 GPIB hacks
	•	🔁 Edge detection & transform math
	•	🎞️ Final output on 35mm film

I built all of it in about 12 weekends, collaborating with a graphics shop that was printing 4Kx4K raster images to film.

📸 At 300 dpi and 512x512 color, this thing wasn’t just cool — it was 10 years ahead of its time.

So…

I’ll reverse-engineer your secrets, hack your hardware, and outship your roadmap — before your R&D team gets out of their staff meeting.
