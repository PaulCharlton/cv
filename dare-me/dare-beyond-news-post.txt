🚀 Dare me to do it again!

In 1996, I left Apple after launching QTML at WWDC to co-found a startup around my idea for a consumer shopping engine (“QE2”).

But we pivoted fast—into something bigger.

💡 Beyond News Inc. was born: a social news platform where users could comment on stories and each other. Reddit + Twitter… in 1996.

Our early advisor, Yossi Amram (Individual Inc IPO), introduced us to Lexis-Nexis—then the world’s largest private news archive (10TB+). Their main client? 🕵️ The CIA. They wanted a web frontend, a crawler, and a social layer. We signed a $75K contract.

🛠️ I delivered a prototype in weeks.
💣 And then: betrayal.

By mid-December, I knew Lexis-Nexis had paid us on our first milestones — but I hadn’t seen a cent. I was broke. Credit cards maxed. The other founders? Silent.

🎄 On Dec 24, I walked.
🧾 Formed Charlton Innovations Inc.
🧊 Let them stew over the holidays.

In January, they came back begging. They needed me to finish.

✅ I agreed—on my terms:
	•	💵 Prepaid weekly
	•	📜 Shares vest by milestone, not time
	•	📦 Physical share certificates at each stage
	•	🤝 All work via my own company

Take it or leave it.
They took it.

By summer ’97, they raised $1M. Then 💥 “termination for convenience.” No final check. No final shares.

Weeks later, Lexis-Nexis dropped them—partly over how I’d been treated. The founders scrambled, pivoted back to QE2, and rebranded as C2B Technologies.

📞 July 1998 (a year later):
A stranger calls. “Will you take $800K for your shares?”

🚩 I smelled a setup.

My attorney investigated. 💥 Boom: Inktomi was acquiring C2B for $90M in stock. They had just discovered I still owned 20%—undisclosed in diligence.

🧠 We found the “termination for convenience” email.
📌 Cited “excused performance.”
📬 My final share certificate was delivered the next day.

I signed off—with full recognition of my equity.

📜 Weeks later, I had an Inktomi share certificate worth $30M on my nightstand.

If I’d held to peak? $300M.
But I cashed out early. And quietly.

🕶️ Didn’t make the “Top 50 Earners” list.
✅ Preferred the privacy.
💯 Kept the receipts.

They tried to erase me.
Instead, I made the exit happen.

Dare me to do it again.
