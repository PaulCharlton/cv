Life is But a Dream... [caveats]

This collection of stories is my best current recollection of how things happened and who was involved.  Mistakes are bound to me made, and will be corrected upon request and further research.  Most of the initiatives described in the stories were solo individual contributor efforts unless otherwise noted.  I have not [yet] named other contributors because I have yet to seek their consent for use of their names in the stories [with the exception of well known celebrities and senior corporate officers who had public facing responsibilities.]  At this moment, I am loving to revive contact with other participants and include their recollections here as well.
